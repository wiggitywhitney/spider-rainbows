## Overview

Interactive React demo application featuring a rainbow image with spider add/remove functionality and a delightful easter egg. Built for platform engineering demonstrations where the goal is to provide an amusing, containerized application that showcases deployment capabilities.

**Tech Stack**: React 19 + Vite + Express.js + Docker

---

## Problem Statement

Platform engineering demonstrations require an application that is:
- Visually engaging and amusing to capture attention
- Simple enough to deploy quickly in demo scenarios
- Complex enough to demonstrate real-world containerization
- Interactive to show live functionality during presentations

---

## Solution

A React-based web application featuring:
- Static rainbow background image
- Interactive button to add/remove a spider
- **85% probability**: Single spider appears on the rainbow
- **15% probability**: Easter egg triggers - spider swarm covers the entire rainbow with dramatic button styling
- Responsive design that works across screen sizes
- Fully containerized in Docker with health monitoring

---

## User Journey

### Normal Flow (85% probability)
1. User sees rainbow with button labeled "Add spider?"
2. User clicks button
3. Single spider appears at top of rainbow (25% of rainbow width)
4. Rainbow opacity fades from 100% to 75%
5. Button text changes to "Remove spider?"
6. User clicks button again
7. Spider disappears
8. Rainbow returns to 100% opacity
9. Button resets to "Add spider?"

### Easter Egg Flow (15% probability)
1. User sees rainbow with button labeled "Add spider?"
2. User clicks button
3. Spider swarm image fills entire rainbow
4. Rainbow opacity fades from 100% to 75%
5. Button text changes to "AHHHHHH!!!"
6. Button gains black outline styling (box-shadow)
7. User clicks "AHHHHHH!!!" button
8. Spider swarm disappears
9. Rainbow returns to 100% opacity
10. Button resets to "Add spider?"

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure

```
App.jsx (Main Orchestrator)
├── State Management
│   ├── spiderVisible (boolean)
│   ├── spiderType ('regular' | 'surprise' | null)
│   └── rainbowWidth (number)
├── Rainbow.jsx (Image with opacity control)
├── AddSpiderButton.jsx (Three text states)
├── SpiderImage.jsx (Regular single spider)
├── SurpriseSpider.jsx (Easter egg swarm)
└── utils/spiderUtils.js (Probability logic)
```

### State Management
```javascript
const [spiderVisible, setSpiderVisible] = useState(false);
const [spiderType, setSpiderType] = useState(null); // 'regular' | 'surprise' | null
const [rainbowWidth, setRainbowWidth] = useState(0);
```

### Easter Egg Implementation
```javascript
// spiderUtils.js
export const selectSpiderType = () => {
  const random = Math.random();
  return random < 0.15 ? 'surprise' : 'regular';
};
```

### Visual Specifications

#### Button States
| State | Text | Additional Styling |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| No spider | "Add spider?" | Default |
| Regular spider | "Remove spider?" | Default |
| Surprise spider | "AHHHHHH!!!" | Black outline (box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px black) |

#### Button Styling
- **Font**: Custom spider font (spider-font.ttf)
- **Font Size**: 31px
- **Padding**: 10px 21px
- **Background**: White
- **Border**: 2px white
- **Position**: Bottom left (25% from left edge, below left cloud)

#### Spider Positioning

**Regular Spider:**
- Position: Top 10% of rainbow container
- Width: 25% of rainbow width
- Z-index: 5
- Centered horizontally

**Surprise Spider:**
- Position: Fills entire rainbow container (absolute positioning: 0, 0, 0, 0)
- Size: Full width/height with `object-fit: contain`
- Z-index: 10
- Centered with flexbox

#### Z-index Layering
```
Button (z-index: 11)
  ↓
Surprise Spider (z-index: 10)
  ↓
Regular Spider (z-index: 5)
  ↓
Rainbow (z-index: 0)
```

#### Rainbow Opacity
- **No spider**: 100% opacity
- **Spider present**: 75% opacity
- Applied via inline style based on `isSpiderPresent` prop

### Responsive Design
- Rainbow layout: `width: 80%; max-width: none;`
- Dynamic width calculation using ref and resize listeners
- Spider sizing scales relative to rainbow width
- Mobile-friendly touch interactions

### Docker Configuration

**Container Setup**: Single container, single process (Kubernetes best practice)
- Runs production Express server on port 8080
- Serves built React app (static files from `dist/`)
- Provides dedicated `/health` endpoint for Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes
- Node.js base image
- Exposes only port 8080 (serves both app and health endpoint)
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health` (returns JSON with status, uptime, timestamp)

**Architecture Decision** (2025-10-16, updated 2025-10-17):
- **One process per container** - Follows Kubernetes philosophy
- **No dependency checking in health endpoint** - Prevents cascading failures
- **Production build approach** - Serves optimized static React build, not dev server
- **Single port** - Simplifies networking and follows standard web app patterns
- **Graceful shutdown handling** (2025-10-17) - SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers for zero-downtime deployments

**Production Server Implementation** (`server.js`):
```javascript
import express from 'express'
import path from 'path'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'

// ES module __dirname equivalent
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename)

const app = express()
const PORT = 8080

// Health endpoint for Kubernetes probes
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
  })
})

// Serve static React build
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')))

// SPA routing - serve index.html for all other routes
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'))
})

const server = app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`)
  console.log(`Health endpoint: http://localhost:${PORT}/health`)
})

// Graceful shutdown handling for Kubernetes pod termination
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.log('SIGTERM received, closing server gracefully...')
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Server closed')
    process.exit(0)
  })
})

process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  console.log('SIGINT received, closing server gracefully...')
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Server closed')
    process.exit(0)
  })
})
```

**Kubernetes Probe Configuration Example**:
```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
  failureThreshold: 3
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

### NPM Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server (port 8080) - for local development
- `npm run build` - Production build (creates `dist/` directory with optimized static files)
- `npm start` - Start Express server (serves built React app + `/health` endpoint on port 8080)

## Implementation Notes

### Key Architecture Decisions (from original implementation)

**What Worked Well:**
1. **Component separation** - Clean, focused components
2. **Simple state management** - useState is sufficient, no need for Context/Redux
3. **Z-index layering** - Clear visual hierarchy
4. **Probability utility** - Simple and effective Math.random() approach
5. **Responsive sizing** - Dynamic calculation from rainbow ref
6. **Opacity effect** - Subtle visual feedback enhances UX

**Design Choices:**
- 15% probability (not 10%) - based on original implementation testing
- Rainbow opacity fade to 75% - provides nice visual feedback
- Separate components for regular/surprise spiders - cleaner than conditional styling
- Custom font - adds personality and polish to the demo

### Technical Considerations

**Vite + React 19:**
- Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for development
- React 19 features available if needed
- ES modules support required in Node.js

**Docker Strategy (Updated 2025-10-16):**
- Single container, single process follows Kubernetes best practices
- Production Express server serves both static React build and `/health` endpoint
- One exposed port (8080) simplifies networking
- Health endpoint designed for Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes
- No dependency checking in health endpoint prevents cascading failures
- Production build approach demonstrates real-world deployment patterns

**Responsive Approach:**
- Rainbow width tracked via ref
- Window resize listeners update spider sizing
- Touch-friendly for mobile demos

### 2025-10-16 - Architecture Decision: Kubernetes-Native Health Check Approach
**Duration**: ~30 minutes (research + decision)
**Primary Focus**: Health check architecture design and Kubernetes best practices research

**Context**:
During planning for Milestone 5 (Docker containerization), questions arose about the dual-server approach (Vite dev server on 8080 + separate Express health server on 3001):
- Should health endpoint check if Vite server is responding?
- What happens if one server crashes but not the other?
- Is running two processes in one container a good practice?

**Research Conducted**:
- Kubernetes official documentation on liveness/readiness probes
- Industry best practices for health checks in microservices
- Analysis of cascading failure patterns in health check implementations

**Key Findings**:
1. **One process per container** is Kubernetes best practice - avoid replicating orchestration logic
2. **Liveness probes should NOT check dependencies** - prevents cascading failures
3. **Health endpoints checking other services** create avalanche effects when widely-used services fail
4. **Kubernetes can probe HTTP endpoints directly** - no need for separate health server
5. **Production containers should serve production builds**, not dev servers

**Decision Made**: Option B - Production-Grade Single Server
- Build `production-server.js` that serves React production build + `/health` endpoint
- Single Express process on port 8080 (both app and health endpoint)
- Health endpoint only checks Express process health, no dependency checking
- Follows "one process per container" principle

**Impact**:
- ✅ Milestone 5 requirements updated to reflect new architecture
- ✅ Docker configuration simplified (single port, single process)
- ✅ NPM scripts updated (`npm start` for production server)
- ⚠️ `server.js` (separate health server) will be deprecated for container use (kept for local dev reference)
- 🔨 Need to create `production-server.js` before completing Milestone 5

**Rationale**:
This decision makes the demo more impressive for Kubernetes audiences by:
- Demonstrating understanding of Kubernetes principles
- Showing production-realistic deployment patterns
- Explaining why cascading failures are avoided
- Following industry best practices that can be cited during demos

**Next Steps**:
- Create `production-server.js` with integrated health endpoint
- Create Dockerfile using single-process pattern
- Document Kubernetes probe configuration for demo purposes

### 2025-10-17 - Milestone 4.5 Complete: Production Server with Graceful Shutdown
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Production server implementation, graceful shutdown, and code refactoring

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] Created `server.js` with ES module support (fileURLToPath for __dirname)
- [x] Implemented `/health` endpoint (JSON with status, uptime, timestamp)
- [x] Implemented static file serving from `dist/` directory
- [x] Implemented SPA routing fallback (all routes → index.html)
- [x] Added graceful shutdown handlers (SIGTERM and SIGINT)
- [x] Server stores reference for graceful shutdown
- [x] Added `npm start` script to package.json
- [x] Tested production build process (`npm run build`)
- [x] Tested production server locally (`npm start`)
- [x] Verified app loads at localhost:8080 with full functionality
- [x] Verified health endpoint responds at localhost:8080/health
- [x] Deleted obsolete health-only server
- [x] Cleaned up package.json (removed obsolete `health` script)

**Files Created**:
- `server.js` - Production Express server with integrated health endpoint and graceful shutdown

**Files Deleted**:
- Old `server.js` (health-only server on port 3001, now obsolete)

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json` - Updated scripts: added `npm start`, removed `npm run health`
- `prds/1-spider-rainbows-demo.md` - Updated architecture decisions, code examples, milestone requirements

**Key Implementation Details**:
```javascript
// Graceful shutdown implementation
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.log('SIGTERM received, closing server gracefully...')
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Server closed')
    process.exit(0)
  })
})
```

**Architecture Refinements**:
- **Naming decision**: Changed from `production-server.js` to `server.js` (Node.js convention)
- **Single responsibility**: One server handles both app serving and health checks
- **Production patterns**: Serves optimized React build, not dev server
- **Kubernetes-ready**: Graceful shutdown for zero-downtime deployments

**Verified Working**:
- ✅ `npm run build` creates optimized production bundle
- ✅ `npm start` runs server on port 8080
- ✅ App loads and displays correctly at http://localhost:8080
- ✅ Health endpoint returns proper JSON at http://localhost:8080/health
- ✅ User confirmed "It works" and "the app works!"
- ✅ Both regular spider and easter egg flows functional

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Milestone 5: Docker containerization (create Dockerfile, build container, test in Docker)

### 2025-10-17 - Milestone 5 Complete: Docker Containerization and Registry Publication
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Docker containerization, image optimization, DockerHub publication

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] Multi-stage Dockerfile created (build + production stages, Node.js Alpine base)
- [x] `.dockerignore` created (excludes journal/, node_modules, .env, dev files - reduced build context from 99.51MB to 1.35kB)
- [x] Port 8080 exposed and mapped correctly
- [x] Container builds successfully with production React build
- [x] Container runs single-process production Express server
- [x] App accessible and functional at localhost:8080
- [x] Health endpoint responds correctly at localhost:8080/health
- [x] Graceful shutdown verified (SIGTERM handling confirmed)
- [x] Image tagged with semantic versioning (1.0.0) and latest
- [x] Image published to DockerHub (wiggitywhitney/spider-rainbows:1.0.0 and :latest)

**Files Created**:
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage Docker build configuration (build stage with full dependencies + production stage with only runtime deps)
- `.dockerignore` - Build context exclusions for optimal image size

**Verified Working**:
- ✅ Container builds successfully (multi-stage build with layer caching)
- ✅ App serves correctly in container at http://localhost:8080
- ✅ Health endpoint returns JSON: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-10-17T05:37:51.824Z","uptime":33.439}`

- ✅ Build context optimized (99.51MB → 1.35kB - 99.99% reduction!)
- ✅ Images available on DockerHub at wiggitywhitney/spider-rainbows:1.0.0 and :latest

**Kubernetes-Ready Features**:
- Single process per container (follows Kubernetes best practice)
- Health endpoint for liveness/readiness probes
- Graceful shutdown for zero-downtime deployments
- Versioned image tags for reproducible deployments

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Milestone 6: Production documentation (README.md with setup, Docker, Kubernetes instructions)

## Questions & Decisions

### Resolved
✅ **Easter egg probability**: 15% (keeping original)
✅ **Rainbow opacity fade**: Yes, 75% when spider present
✅ **Component structure**: Separate regular/surprise components
✅ **Docker setup**: Single container
✅ **Assets**: Fetch from vibe_practice repo
✅ **Testing approach**: Manual verification only
✅ **Priority**: High
✅ **Audience**: Platform engineering demo - goal is to be amusing

✅ **Health Check Architecture for Kubernetes** (2025-10-16)
**Decision**: Use single Express server serving production React build + `/health` endpoint on port 8080, instead of dual-server approach (Vite dev + separate health server)

**Rationale**:
- **Kubernetes best practice**: One process per container - let Kubernetes handle orchestration, not application code
- **Avoid cascading failures**: Health endpoints should NOT check dependencies (including internal Vite server) to prevent cascading failures when dependent services hang or fail
- **Liveness vs Readiness separation**: Kubernetes distinguishes between liveness probes (is process alive?) and readiness probes (can it serve traffic?). Health endpoint should only check if the Express process itself is healthy, not probe other services
- **Production-realistic**: Demo should showcase real-world patterns - serving production builds, not dev servers in containers
- **Simpler networking**: Single port (8080) for both app and health checks follows standard web app patterns

**Impact on PRD**:
- **Milestone 4.5 added**: Production server refactoring before containerization
- **Milestone 5 requirements changed**: Need to build `server.js` instead of running dual servers
- **NPM scripts updated**: Add `npm start` for production server, removed obsolete `npm run health`
- **Docker configuration simplified**: Expose only port 8080, single process supervision
- **Code deprecated**: Old health-only server removed, replaced by integrated health endpoint in main server
- **Cleaner naming**: `server.js` follows Node.js conventions (not "production-server.js")

- Kubernetes best practices: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/
- Research showed dual-process containers and dependency checking in health endpoints create cascading failures

✅ **Graceful Shutdown Handling** (2025-10-17)
**Decision**: Include SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers in production server for graceful shutdown

**Rationale**:
- **Kubernetes pod lifecycle** - When Kubernetes terminates a pod, it sends SIGTERM before SIGKILL, allowing graceful shutdown
- **Zero-downtime deployments** - Server stops accepting new connections but finishes in-flight requests before exiting
- **Demo value** - Shows production awareness and understanding of container orchestration lifecycle
- **Small implementation cost** - Only ~15 lines of code for significant production readiness improvement
- **Best practice demonstration** - Valuable talking point during platform engineering demos

**Implementation approach**:
- Capture server reference: `const server = app.listen(...)`
- Handle SIGTERM: `server.close()` → finish in-flight requests → `process.exit(0)`
- Handle SIGINT: Same behavior for local development (Ctrl+C)
- Log shutdown events for observability

**Impact on PRD**:
- **Milestone 4.5 added**: Production server refactoring milestone before containerization
- **Code example updated**: `server.js` specification includes graceful shutdown handlers
- **Testing requirements**: Verify Ctrl+C logs shutdown messages correctly
- **Demo enhancement**: Additional talking point about production-grade lifecycle management
- **Cleaner naming decision**: Use `server.js` (Node.js convention) instead of `production-server.js`

**Why include this for a demo app?**:
While this simple HTTP server has no long-running requests or critical state to clean up, including graceful shutdown:
1. Demonstrates production thinking and Kubernetes expertise
2. Provides educational value for platform engineering audiences
3. Models best practices that apply to more complex services
4. Costs minimal implementation effort (~15 lines) for high demo impact
