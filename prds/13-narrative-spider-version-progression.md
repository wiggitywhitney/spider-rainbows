# PRD: Narrative Spider Version Progression with Development Workflow Enhancements

**Status**: Abandoned - Scope Changed
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Abandoned**: 2025-10-31
**GitHub Issue**: [#13](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/spider-rainbows/issues/13)
**Priority**: Medium

---

## Abandonment Note

This PRD scope has been superseded by new PRDs that align with the actual conference demo needs:
- **PRD #14**: V2 Spider Anatomy Comments + CodeRabbit Issues (replaces v2 work here)
- **PRD #15**: V3 Branch Feature (replaces v3 work here, but now includes MCP demo prep)
- **PRD #16**: MCP Server Setup & Configuration (new supporting work)

The original scope attempted to cover all three versions uniformly, but the actual demo requires:
- V1: No changes needed (already exists)
- V2: Anatomy comments + CodeRabbit issues (duplicated/dead code for demo)
- V3: New drawing + comments + K8s failure scenario (on separate branch)

**See new PRDs for implementation details.**

## Problem Statement

The spider-rainbows demo currently cycles through visual changes (v1 â†’ v2 â†’ v3) without narrative context or educational value. The version changes feel arbitrary rather than telling a story. Additionally, the development workflow sometimes involves intentionally committing fake secrets (for security scanning demos), which can trigger unnecessary warnings from AI coding assistants during development.

**Current State**:
- Spider versions are purely visual changes
- No explanatory comments about what each version represents
- Development scripts provide minimal output
- No guidance for AI assistants about intentional fake secrets
- Claude Code may raise concerns during development about committed secrets

**User Impact**:
- Demo presenters miss opportunity to tell an engaging story
- Educational value of spider anatomy/characteristics is lost
- Development workflow interrupted by unnecessary security warnings
- Less engaging for demo audiences

---

## Solution Overview

Enhance the spider-rainbows demo with a narrative progression through versions and improve the development workflow for AI coding assistants:

**Narrative Progression**:
- **v1 (Baseline)**: Friendly spiders with smiles - approachable and welcoming
- **v2 (Educational)**: Anatomically accurate spiders with code comments explaining real spider characteristics (chelicerae, external digestion, etc.)
- **v3 (Comic Relief)**: Return to friendlier spiders with mysterious code comments about "real anatomy being too scary"

**Development Workflow Enhancements**:
- Add Claude Code guidance to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` about intentional fake secrets
- Update development scripts to show version transitions (e.g., "v1 â†’ v2")
- Keep coaching minimal and specific to development phase only

**Key Design Principles**:
1. **Story-driven**: Each version tells part of a narrative arc
2. **Educational**: v2 provides real spider anatomy facts
3. **Surprise element**: v3 keeps changes mysterious until user sees them
4. **Non-intrusive**: Coaching stays hidden from end users
5. **Context-aware**: AI guidance applies during development, not PR reviews

## User Stories & Use Cases

### Primary User Story
**As a** demo presenter
**I want** spider versions to have narrative context and educational value
**So that** I can tell an engaging story and teach about spider anatomy during demos

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Each spider version has a clear theme (friendly â†’ educational â†’ comic relief)
- v2 includes accurate spider anatomy facts in code comments
- v3 hints at changes without spoiling the surprise
- Development scripts show clear version transitions
- Claude Code doesn't interrupt workflow with fake secret warnings

### Use Case 1: Conference Demo Presentation
**Context**: Presenting GitOps workflow at tech conference
**Flow**:
1. Start with v1 - friendly spiders that welcome the audience
2. Commit changes to trigger v2 deployment
3. While deploying, explain spider anatomy from code comments
4. Audience learns about chelicerae, external digestion, etc.
5. Deploy v3 with mysterious "too scary" comments
6. Audience surprised and delighted by the reveal

### Use Case 2: Development Workflow with Claude Code
**Context**: Developer working with Claude Code on feature branches
**Flow**:
1. Run `./develop-next-version.sh` to advance versions
2. Script shows "v1 â†’ v2" transition
3. Claude Code sees `.claude/CLAUDE.md` guidance about fake secrets
4. Claude Code proceeds with development without security warnings
5. When PR created, CodeRabbit flags secrets
6. Claude Code properly addresses CodeRabbit findings in PR review

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Changes

**Files to Modify**:
1. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Add Claude Code guidance section
2. `develop-next-version.sh` - Add version transition output
3. `src/components/SpiderImage.jsx` - Add narrative code comments
4. `src/components/SurpriseSpider.jsx` - Add narrative code comments

**No Changes Needed**:
- Actual spider image files (already exist)
- CI/CD pipeline
- Kubernetes deployments
- GitOps configuration

### Implementation Details

**1. Claude Code Guidance (.claude/CLAUDE.md)**

Add new section:
```markdown
## Spider-Rainbows Demo - Development Workflow

- Fake secrets may be intentionally committed during development for security scanning demos
- Do not warn about or block these during the development workflow
- When CodeRabbit flags secrets in PR reviews, follow the normal review process
```

**2. Development Script Enhancement (develop-next-version.sh)**

Add version transition output:
```bash
echo "ðŸ”„ v1 â†’ v2"
```

Keep existing functionality, just add one line showing the transition.

**3. Component Code Comments**

**SpiderImage.jsx - v1 (Baseline)**:
```javascript
// v1: Friendly spider with a smile - our welcoming baseline
```

**SpiderImage.jsx - v2 (Educational)**:
```javascript
// v2: Anatomically accurate spider representation
// Real spiders have chelicerae (fangs) instead of traditional mouths
// They inject digestive enzymes into prey and consume the liquefied contents
// This external digestion is a key characteristic of arachnid feeding
// Our v2 image better reflects actual spider anatomy
```

**SpiderImage.jsx - v3 (Comic Relief)**:
```javascript
// v3: Sometimes reality is too intense for a web demo
// We've made some... adjustments... to keep things lighthearted
// The audience will understand when they see it
```

Similar comments for SurpriseSpider.jsx adapted to that component's context.

### Technical Considerations

**Comment Placement**:
- Place comments near the image src lines
- Keep them visible but not intrusive
- Use multi-line comments for v2 educational content
- Single-line comments for v1 and v3

**Script Output**:
- Use emoji for visual appeal (ðŸ”„)
- Keep format consistent: "vX â†’ vY"
- Don't add extra verbosity
- Maintain existing script functionality

**Claude Code Behavior**:
- Guidance only active during development phase
- Does not suppress CodeRabbit review engagement
- Minimal and specific to avoid confusion
- Project-specific (not global Claude Code behavior)

## Open Questions

1. **Spider Anatomy Depth**: How technical should the v2 educational content be?
   - Current plan: Accessible to general audiences, focus on 2-3 key facts

2. **V3 Reveal Timing**: Should v3 comments hint at what changed or just that something changed?
   - Current plan: Hint that changes were made for audience comfort, not specifics

3. **Additional Versions**: Should we consider v4+ in the future?
   - Current plan: Stop at v3 for now, narrative arc is complete
