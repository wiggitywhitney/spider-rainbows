# Complete PRD Implementation

Complete the PRD implementation workflow including branch management, pull request creation, and issue closure.

## Workflow Steps

### 0. Implementation Type Detection
**FIRST: Determine the type of PRD completion to choose the appropriate workflow**

**Documentation-Only Completion** (Skip PR workflow):
- ✅ Changes are only to PRD files or project management documents
- ✅ No source code changes
- ✅ No configuration changes
- ✅ Feature was already implemented in previous work
- → **Use Simplified Workflow** (Steps 1, 2-simplified, 5 only)

**Code Implementation Completion** (Full PR workflow):
- ✅ Contains source code changes
- ✅ Contains configuration changes
- ✅ Contains new functionality or modifications
- ✅ Requires testing and integration
- → **Use Full Workflow** (Steps 1-6)

### 1. Pre-Completion Validation
- [ ] **All PRD checkboxes completed**: Verify every requirement is implemented and tested
- [ ] **All tests passing**: Run project test suite to ensure quality standards (skip if documentation-only)
- [ ] **Documentation updated**: All user-facing docs reflect implemented functionality
- [ ] **No outstanding blockers**: All dependencies resolved and technical debt addressed
- [ ] **Update PRD status**: Mark PRD as "Complete" with completion date

### 2. Branch and Commit Management

**For Documentation-Only Completions:**
- [ ] **Commit directly to main**: `git add [prd-files]` and commit with skip CI flag
- [ ] **Use skip CI commit message**: Include CI skip pattern in commit message to avoid unnecessary CI runs
  - Common patterns: `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `***NO_CI***`, `[skip actions]`
  - Check project's CI configuration for the correct pattern
- [ ] **Push to remote**: `git push origin main` to sync changes

**For Code Implementation Completions:**
- [ ] **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/prd-[issue-id]-[feature-name]`
- [ ] **Commit all changes**: Ensure all implementation work is committed
- [ ] **Clean commit history**: Squash or organize commits for clear history
- [ ] **Push to remote**: `git push -u origin feature/prd-[issue-id]-[feature-name]`

### 3. Pull Request Creation
- [ ] **Create PR**: Use `gh pr create` with comprehensive description
- [ ] **Link to PRD**: Reference the original issue and PRD file
- [ ] **Review checklist**: Include testing, documentation, and quality confirmations
- [ ] **Request reviews**: Assign appropriate team members for code review

### 4. Review and Merge Process
- [ ] **Check ongoing processes**: Use `gh pr checks [pr-number]` to check for any ongoing CI/CD, security analysis, or automated reviews (CodeRabbit, CodeQL, etc.)
- [ ] **Check PR details**: Use `gh pr view [pr-number]` to check for human review comments and PR metadata
- [ ] **Review all automated feedback**: Check PR comments section for automated code review feedback (bots, linters, analyzers)
  - **Use multiple methods to capture all feedback**:
    - CLI commands: `gh pr view [pr-number]`, `gh pr checks [pr-number]`, `gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/[pr-number]/comments`
    - **Web interface inspection**: Fetch the PR URL directly to capture all comments, including inline code suggestions that CLI tools may miss
    - Look for comments from automated tools (usernames ending in 'ai', 'bot', or known review tools)
- [ ] **Present code review findings**: ALWAYS summarize automated review feedback for the user (unless there are no findings)
  - **Categorize findings**: Critical, Important, Optional based on impact
  - **Provide specific examples**: Quote actual suggestions and their locations
  - **Explain assessment**: Why each category was assigned and which items should be addressed
  - **User decision**: Let user decide which optional improvements to implement before merge
- [ ] **Assess feedback priority**: Categorize review feedback
  - **Critical**: Security issues, breaking changes, test failures - MUST address before merge
  - **Important**: Code quality, maintainability, performance - SHOULD address for production readiness
  - **Optional**: Style preferences, minor optimizations - MAY address based on project standards
- [ ] **Wait for ALL reviews to complete**: Do NOT merge if any reviews are pending or in progress, including:
  - **Automated code reviews** (CodeRabbit, CodeQL, etc.) - Must wait until complete even if CI passes
  - **Security analysis** - Must complete and pass
  - **CI/CD processes** - All builds and tests must pass
  - **Human reviews** - If requested reviewers haven't approved
  - **CRITICAL**: Never skip automated code reviews - they provide valuable feedback even when CI passes
- [ ] **Address review feedback**: Make required changes from code review (both automated and human)
  - Create additional commits on the feature branch to address feedback
  - Update tests if needed to cover suggested improvements
  - Document any feedback that was intentionally not addressed and why
- [ ] **Verify all checks pass**: Ensure all CI/CD, tests, security analysis, and automated processes are complete and passing
- [ ] **Final review**: Confirm the PR addresses the original PRD requirements and maintains code quality
- [ ] **Merge to main**: Complete the pull request merge only after all feedback addressed and processes complete
- [ ] **Verify deployment**: Ensure feature works in production environment
- [ ] **Monitor for issues**: Watch for any post-deployment problems

### 5. Issue Closure
- [ ] **Close GitHub issue**: Add final completion comment and close
- [ ] **Archive artifacts**: Save any temporary files or testing data if needed
- [ ] **Team notification**: Announce feature completion to relevant stakeholders

### 6. Branch Cleanup
- [ ] **Switch to main branch**: `git checkout main`
- [ ] **Pull latest changes**: `git pull origin main` to ensure local main is up to date
- [ ] **Delete local feature branch**: `git branch -d feature/prd-[issue-id]-[feature-name]`
- [ ] **Delete remote feature branch**: `git push origin --delete feature/prd-[issue-id]-[feature-name]`

## Success Criteria
✅ **Feature is live and functional**
✅ **All tests passing in production**
✅ **Documentation is accurate and complete**
✅ **PRD issue is closed with completion summary**
✅ **Team is notified of feature availability**

The PRD implementation is only considered done when users can successfully use the feature as documented.
